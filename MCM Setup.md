# Mod Configuration Menu Setup
Once you've created your character and the notifications in the top left of your vision have stopped appearing, follow the rest of these steps to get your mods configured and ready to go.

**As of Tahrovin V0.2.1 update, MCM setup is now automatically handled by MCM Recorder. Follow the steps below to run the setup via the MCM Recorder menu.**

## Running MCM Recorder
Once you've started a new game and made your character, do nothing else until the messages in the top left of your vision stop appearing. Once they have stopped, you can continue.

Head into the Mod Configuration menu and scroll down to MCM Recorder. Once there, select the `Tahrovin V0.2.1` option:

Back out of the Mod Configuration menu and you should be met with another menu. Click the `Play Recording` option:

Let it run (note: it will take a couple of minutes!) and when it is finished another dialog box will pop-up confirming that MCM Recorder has finished:

Click **OK** and you are done! The mods are configured. Now make a proper save and you can continue on with the game.
