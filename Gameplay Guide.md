## Starting Out
When you first start a new game, you won't find yourself inside of Skyrim anywhere. Instead, you will be inside of the Realm of Lorkhan. This mod replaces the vanilla Skyrim intro, which is known to be extremely buggy, especially in VR. 

*I'm sure you've seen the vanilla intro already, right?* 

The Realm of Lorkhan mod allows you to craft a character that can be allied with factions out of the gate, spawn with all sorts of different equipment, choose classes for your character and start in many different locations. Have a walk about, see what's around and available to you. Once you teleport at one of the crystals, you'll be dumped into Skyrim in the place you chose. Make your choices wisely though - once you leave, you cannot return.

## The Main Quest
There's a lot to do in Tahrovin, so much so you can actually ignore the main quest of Skyrim. There are no dragons until you start the main quest so you're free to roam in a (mostly) peaceful Skyrim. If you really, really want to do the main quest grab the Dragonstone from Bleak Falls Barrow or talk to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun.

## The World
Tahrovin doesn't make Skyrim extremely difficult. It does make high level areas actually mean high level in that the enemies across the whole of Skyrim and beyond are tweaked, balanced, given perks and spells to actually make a fight feel like a fight.

If you're not wanting to die a lot as you start, keep the Whiterun Hold area to have somewhat lower level enemies and quests. Avoid Dwemer or Falmer dungeons as they definitely will rock you if you try them.

## What do I do now?
Walk around Skyrim, check out inns and talk to innkeepers. There are people everywhere, most with something interesting to say or something for you to do. There are a bunch of custom followers around, some with unique quests that they give you. Some even have unique quests to even get them as followers.

## Can I get a hint?
*sigh*

Sure, try asking around the Winking Skeever - the barkeep might know something. Maybe the patrons do too. 

Or even take yourself a trip up to the Nightgate Inn - by the Gods they could do with your patronage. Have yourself a nice sleep and in the morning, take yourself for a nice walk West on the road just North of the inn.

If you're feeling brave, I hear there's a place on the North of Solstheim that might be interesting.

## Where do I live/store my stuff/keep my followers?
The Dragonborn Museum has a lovely safehouse that you can unlock after a bit of labour on your behalf. All the vanilla homes are available after becoming Thane in the respective Hold. There are also a few new player homes if you know where to look or who to talk to.

## How do I get gold?
Quests. Dungeons.

## Can I play as [insert playstyle here]?
Most likely - Tahrovin uses Vokriinator (not Vokriinator Black) for perks and gameplay styles changes. There's *a lot* to pick from and I have no doubt you can find yourself an obscure build in there somewhere.

If you pick Stealth Archer though, I will find you.

## How the heck do I use half of these mods?
Firstly, welcome to Skyrim VR - I hope you enjoy your stay.

Secondly, I suggest you watch a couple of videos:

Come back when you're done and I'm sure you'll be prepped and ready to go.
