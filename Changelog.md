22. Dropped the More GPU than braincells Profile for now - I do not own a 4090 so I am unable to test or troubleshoot this profile which makes it an unreasonable task to try and keep up, will be running a donation goal until Nov.20th to try and bring it back.

## Tahrovin v1.0.85

6. Added Submissive Lola(if you wish to start it you need to configure it to your liking from the mcm and then hit start quest)
7. Added SL Tools, you can bind a button to animation selection in the MCM to give you more choice over what scenes will play in SL events.
8. Updated Coldsun1's Open Composite mod for compatibility with VDXR for those that know what they are doing
9. Drop on Death updated to a more stable version.
10. Removed SkyVRaan (replaced by Cubemap Reflections)

Because of the merges this update may not be savesafe, you can attempt to keep your save by cleaning it with Fallrim Tools after updating but I'm not 100% that that would work, at the very least you would have to register the new animations in the SLAL MCM
