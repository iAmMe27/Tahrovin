# Steps to install reshade 6 with open composite

- Make sure you have glamur and 5.9.2 reshade binaries untucked under the reshade tab
- download reshade 6 from the official reshade website and choose the version with full add-on support
- run the installer and navigate it to Tahrovin/Stock Game/SkyrimVR.exe
- check OpenXR from the list
- check every single effect or click uncheck all and then check all
- add-ons are optional, take what you want or just click finish
- in MO2 click the puzzle pieces icon then go to rootbuilder and click build
- check the presets you want to try under reshade i.e. klarity Fjord and skyward
- go to your steamVR settings and make sure steam is managing OpenXR applications even if you typically use a different method i.e. virtual desktop or air link
- make sure Tahrovin is set to open composite, launch steamVR and run Tahrovin.
- once Tahrovin is open you should see a rainbow circle tab in the steamVR menu, click that
- here you will click skip tutorial, the click the setting tab and click the plus next to effects and navigate it to Stock Game/reshade-shaders/shaders
- click the plus next to textures and navigate it to Stock Game/reshade-shaders/textures
- click back to the first tab and click the preset drop-down and select your desired preset
- check the performance mode box and then click reload
- swap back to your game and then exit it
- you can now swap your OpenXR environment back to VDXR or oculus if you use those and run the game normally and your reshade preset should load with it ðŸ™‚
- the files that reshade installed may end up in the overwrites folder after running, if that happens right click overwrite and install overwrite as mod and put it under the reshade subheader
