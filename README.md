First things first: __this list contains adult content and you must be of legal age in your country. This means 18+ in most countries, 21+ in others. It is up to you to be sure of the age requirement in your country.__

## What is Tahrovin?
Tahrovin is a NSFW Skyrim VR modlist that aims to improve and add upon the Skyrim VR experience. The list features most, if not all, of the fundamental mods needed for any Skyrim VR mod list. The list offers plenty of eye candy paired with everyone's favourite jiggle physics. Yes, this means plenty of slooty outfits and selectively crafted bodyslides - and no, it's not supposed to be immersive. Don't worry for those who prefer to play as a male character, the males have also received attention in this list.

## Before you start
Before you dive in, there's a couple things you need to be sure of first:

### Hardware Requirements
I run a relatively powerful PC with the following specs:
  * CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X
  * RAM: 32GB DDR4 @ 3600Hz
  * GPU: RTX 3080

I use an Oculus Quest 2 headset with an Oculus link cable for the best potential performance. 

Now, I've not built this list to be as graphically as intensive as possible but I have taken some liberties in installing higher resolution textures as well as offering a couple of the more demanding ENB presets available. With that in mind, I'd recommend at least the following specs for the best experience:
  * CPU: Intel 7th gen *OR* AMD 3000 series 
  * RAM: 16GBs of DDR4
  * GPU: GTX 1080 *or the AMD equivalent with at least 6GB of VRAM*

You will need at least `XYZ GB` of disk space on an SSD. It doesn't have to be an NVMe SSD, but a HDD of any kind will make the list painfully unplayable. 

### Accounts
In terms of accounts you will need:
  * Nexus Premium Account
  * LoversLab Account

Whilst you don't *need* a Nexus premium account to install the modlist, you'll have a considerably better time of it if you do.
