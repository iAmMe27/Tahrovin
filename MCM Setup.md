# Mod Configuration Menu Setup
Once you've created your character and the notifications in the top left of your vision have stopped appearing, follow the rest of these steps to get your mods configured and ready to go.

## FEC
First up is FEC. Technically this one is optional and based on preference but I like to disable *Extended death camera* in the menu for FEC.

## SexLab
Scroll down and find your way to SexLab. On the first menu, ensure that all the prerequisites are **OK** and then click the **Install/Update SexLab SL VR Patch...** option. Once done and the text changes, close the menu (as in all the way back to the game), wait for the message in the top left of your vision to say the mod is ready and then reopen the SexLab mod configuration menu to confirm the mod initialised properly. Once you've re-opened the menu, scroll down to **Animation Settings** and ensure that **Enable Creature Animations** is checked, if you want creature animations enabled.

## SexLab Eager NPCs
In the SLEN menu, start by checking the **Mod Enabled** option. Once activated, exit all the way out of the menus and then wait for the notification in the top left of your vision before re-opening the SLEN mod configuration menu, confirming that the mod has been successfully enabled.

If enabled, check the **Charm dialogue** option and also configure the rest to your liking. A recommended minimum setup is as follows:
* SLEN Dialogues:
  * Lover's Perks dialogue - *ON*
* Sleep event
  * A pleasant surprise (chance) - *33%*
  * Gives Lover's Comfort - *ON*
* Dragon kill event
  * Dragon soul absorb exposure - *50*
  * Dragon kill witness exposure - *20*
  * Orgy chance - *33%*
* Location clear event
  * Orgy chance - *33%*
* Dibella's Refuge
  * Enabler Diblla's Refuge quests - *ON*
* SLEN Spells
  * Add Masturbate lesser power - *ON*
  * Mounter exposure - *10 per min*

## Simply Balanced
In the Simply Balanced configuration menu set:
* General Balance
  * Adjust Damage Sources - *ON*
  * Damage Sources
    * Archery Damage - *50%*

I also recommend setting *Dagger Damage, Axe Damage, Sword Damage* and *Mace Damage* to 50% too, because you can move a lot faster in Skyrim VR than you can in other versions of Skyrim. Of course, you're welcome to leave them as they are or tune them to your liking depending on whether or not you want a power fantasy playthrough or a punishing playthrough.

## SL Anim Loader (SLAL)
In the SLAL configuration, click the **Enable All** option.

![SLAL Menu](img/MCM_SLAL1.png)

Once its done enabling, click the **Register Animations** option, exit the MCM all the way and then wait a while. You won't get a notification for this one but there are a lot of animations to register. If you wanted to, you can open the console by using the same key you'd use for Skyrim SE on your PC's keyboard - here you can see all the animations registering and can see when it's done.

Once you can get back into the mod configuration menu, you should be greeted with a message telling you the count of animations that it has registered. Click **OK** and close out of this pop-up.

## Yamete!
In the Yamete mod configuration menu, click the **Enable!** option and exit the MCM. Re-enter the Yamete MCM and confirm that it has been enabled. You can configure some options in here to tweak the mod to your liking.
